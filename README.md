# Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) from Scratch

This repository contains a project where I have built a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) from scratch using Python. The project includes a step-by-step implementation in the Jupyter notebook `RNN_from_scratch.ipynb` and a diagram illustrating the RNN architecture (`RNN Diagram.png`).

## About Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks that are particularly effective for modeling sequential data. Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, RNNs have connections that form cycles, allowing them to maintain a 'memory' of previous inputs in a sequence. This makes RNNs highly suitable for tasks where context and order are essential, such as:

- **Time Series Prediction**: Predicting future values based on past observations.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Handling tasks like text generation, language translation, and sentiment analysis.
- **Speech Recognition**: Recognizing spoken words or phrases by analyzing temporal patterns in audio data.

### Why Use RNNs?

RNNs are powerful because they can model temporal dependencies in sequential data. This is crucial in many real-world applications where the order of data points impacts the overall meaning. RNNs can learn from previous steps in the sequence, making them ideal for tasks that involve time-based or sequential data.

## RNN Built from Scratch

In this project, I've implemented an RNN from the ground up. The `RNN_from_scratch.ipynb` notebook covers:

1. **Understanding the RNN Architecture**: Detailed explanation of how RNNs work, including the forward pass, hidden states, and backpropagation through time (BPTT).
2. **Implementation Details**: Step-by-step coding of an RNN using basic Python and NumPy without relying on high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
3. **Training the RNN**: How the RNN is trained on a sequence-based dataset, including the optimization process and handling of gradients.
4. **Evaluation and Results**: Analyzing the RNN's performance on the given dataset.

### Importance of Building RNNs from Scratch

Building an RNN from scratch is an excellent way to deeply understand the inner workings of recurrent networks. It allows you to:

- **Grasp Core Concepts**: By implementing the model yourself, you gain a stronger understanding of the architecture, data flow, and training process.
- **Learn to Troubleshoot**: Encountering and solving issues during implementation helps you develop problem-solving skills that are crucial when working with more complex models.
- **Appreciate Advanced Libraries**: Understanding the manual implementation process helps you appreciate the abstractions provided by libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
